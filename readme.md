__R2D2-Playground__  
#Intro  
In this R2D2 Swift Playground three tehchnology vendors come together:
- Apple for the Swift programming language and the Swift Playground technology
- Sphero the maker of R2D2
- Fingerfood Studios the creator of the R2D2 Swift Playground

There is a wide variety of useful information related to the R2D2 Swift Playground.

First of all you have to be aware that there are two flavours of swift playgrounds:
- Swift Playgrounds for iOS
- Swift Playgrounds for macOS in Xcode

While the R2D2 Swift Playground __runs__ on iOS, it is __created__ in Xcode on the Mac.

Swift Playgrounds for iOS is a easy and save learning environment. In Playgrounds ofr iOS 
you can explore some features of Swift. It is less complex.  
Swift Playgrounds fin Xcode on the Mac offer a wider variety of possibilities.

##Sphero  
Sphero offers the SpheroEDU App and learning environment which allows you to 
write programs for R2D2 too.  
The SpheroEDU App allows very easy programming by drawing for little children. 
More sophisticated code can be created by dragging codeblocks into a program. 
This already gives full access to all of R2D2s features. Finally you can write 
programs for R2D2 in the Java programming language within the SpheroEDU App.  

There is a Sphero StarWars App in the App Store. But I recommend the SpheroEDU App  
that gives you the possibility to write your own programs for R2D2. Actually in the  
SpheroEDU App you can go beyond what's possible in the R2D2 by Sphero Swift Playground.  
One example is the LEDs that are limited to two colors in the playground but can be  
set to any RBG color in SpheroEDU.
